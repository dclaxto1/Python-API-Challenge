# Module-6---Python-APIs   
Data analysis and manipulation utilizing python APIs       
           
## Part 1: WeatherPy  
In this deliverable, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I used the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and my own problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.

### Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
To fulfill the first requirement, I used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, I created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature <br />

Latitude vs. Humidity<br />

Latitude vs. Cloudiness<br />

Latitude vs. Wind Speed<br />

### Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
To fulfill the second requirement, I computed the linear regression for each relationship. Separated the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). I defined a function in order to create the linear regression plots.

Next, I created a series of scatter plots that include the linear regression line, the model's formula, and the r values.<br />

Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude<br />

Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude<br />

Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude<br />

Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude<br />

Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude<br />

Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude<br />

After each pair of plots, I explained what the linear regression is modeling and described any relationships that I noticed.


## Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, I used my weather data skills to plan future vacations. I also used Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.

### My main task was to to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations.


Created a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.<br />

Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. <br />

My ideal weather conditions:<br />
A max temperature lower than 70 degrees.<br />
Cloudiness less than 15%.<br />
Humidity less than 40%.<br />

Created a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.<br />

For each city, used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of my coordinates.<br />

Added the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map.<br />
